// snapshotLogAttrs renders what recordPhases measures as a per-actor record. The
// histograms cannot be one: actor identity is barred from metric labels
// (docs/metrics/substrate.yaml, cardinality_rules.no-actor-identity), so the
// phase breakdown reaches a backend keyed by template only.
//
// durationKey is the name of the instrument these phases also feed, which is why
// the values are seconds and not the nanoseconds slog.Duration writes: that
// instrument declares unit s. Identity stays out of snapshotOp so no edit here
// can route it into a datapoint.
//
// err is the operation's outcome. The record is written on the way out of a
// failed operation too, so that its completed phases are not lost; error.type
// (the gRPC code, as on the ateapi instruments) marks it so a reader does not
// average a timed-out download in with the successful ones. Absence means
// success, as on the instruments.
