// Package glutton implements the benchmarking workload served by
// cmd/benchmarking/glutton: an API for consuming RAM, disk, and file
// descriptors, and for gossiping with other glutton instances, over either
// gRPC or protobuf-over-HTTP. See internal/proto/glutton/glutton.proto.
package glutton

// Name is the workload's identity to the telemetry SDK: the tracer and meter
// scope, and the service name the binary reports. Instrument names are written
// out in full at each call site so they match docs/metrics/registry/metrics.yaml
// literally.

// blocks RestoreWorkload until it answers 200, so ResumeActor cannot report
// success before the listener is reachable. The fake in ./fake aliases these,
// which is what keeps the stand-in and the real mux from drifting apart.
